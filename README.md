## Thirsty Ottawa

This is the source for thirsty ottawa, a simple web app showing drinking fountains and public washrooms around ottawa. Find it here:

https://thirstyottawa.ca

This was a pretty quick project and my first time using pretty much all of these technologies! Any tips or improvements gladly appreciated.

Note that my Google API key is embedded within the source, but has as many restrictions enabled on the backend as I could muster.

## Dev info

This app is based on node.js, express, and is mostly setup to run on AWS Lambda. Built from the great example I found here: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/going-serverless-migrating-an-express-application-to-amazon-api-gateway-and-aws-lambda/. Written to run against Node.js version 6.10
